# Ember-redux-example

This project is a complete spike at the moment - learning how redux works with ember

//not production ready

## Todos

A few items on my "how does this work" list ...

* what role does a route play now that redux actions return async data?
* how will the ember route and redux work together (so state is tracked in the url)
* what does a pure async example look like?
* what is a boring forms/over data example look like with inputs shown in both master/detail
* what does the deep copy old state/ return new work with relationships?
* how easy is dirty tracking and rollback now?
* share what I learn here w/ the ember community :)
