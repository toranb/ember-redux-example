# Ember-redux-example

This project is a complete spike at the moment - learning how redux works with ember

//not production ready

## Todos

A few items on my "how does this work" list ...

* ~~how will redux and the ember router work together?~~
* how to deep copy an array/object with redux (in the reducer)?
* relationships (and how to keep them in sync as new "state" is created)
* dirty tracking w/ rollback (and save?)
* deserialize workflow / functions
* how does it work with queryParams
* relationship by example (user/ role selectbox widget)
* how to load multiple pieces of state for a "connected" component (like static role data)?
* pure async master + detail
* how to "throw out the store" and restart in tests?
* hot reload w/ ember?
* time travel debugging component for the demo?
* testing examples w/ freeze to show something is immutable ?
* validation (using another addon that relies on ember computed)
* share what I learn here w/ the ember community :)
